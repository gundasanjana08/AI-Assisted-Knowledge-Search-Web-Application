AI-Assisted Knowledge Search Web Application
Overview

This project is a web-based application that allows users to search for information from stored documents. The backend retrieves relevant data and uses an AI service to generate clear, context-aware responses. The goal is to simulate a simple knowledge search system used in internal tools and support platforms.

Key Features

Search interface for querying stored documents

Backend APIs for handling search requests

AI-assisted response generation based on retrieved content

Database storage for documents and metadata

Cloud deployment for easy access and scalability

Tech Stack

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Backend: Node.js, REST APIs

Database: PostgreSQL / MongoDB

AI Integration: LLM API

Cloud & Tools: AWS, Docker, Git

Application Flow

User submits a search query

Backend retrieves relevant documents from the database

AI service generates a summarized or context-aware response

Response is sent back to the frontend

Search results are displayed to the user
